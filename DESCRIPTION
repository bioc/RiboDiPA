Description: This package performs differntial pattern analysis for Ribo-seq data. It identifies genes with significantly different patterns in the ribosome footprint between two conditions. RiboDiPA contains five major components including bam file processing, P-site mapping, data binning, differential pattern analysis and footprint visualization.
